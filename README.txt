CBSWorkload.py is a mini-project I created to try and and get familiar with BeautifulSoup. Ultimately, it should give the
user the ability to choose any CBS-degree from a list, choose their year of studies and then calculate how many hours CBS
estimates will be used on Preparation, Exams and Lectures/Exercises.

Ultimately, the program has no real purpose other than to get familiar with BeautifulSoup and "stripping" .htmls from URLS.
